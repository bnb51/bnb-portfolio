Hello! I'm Breanna, a recent B.S. Computer Science graduate from the University of Pittsburgh. My passion lies in the field of digital forensics analysis, and I am currently seeking job opportunities in digital forensics and data analysis where I can apply my skills to analyze complex data, uncover critical insights, and support vital investigations.

Throughout my academic career, I have developed a solid foundation in computer science principles, coupled with hands-on project experience in various programming languages and technologies. I am proficient in Java, Python, HTML, and SQL, along with a background in database management and data analysis. I have experience deriving insights from datasets and have worked with tools and techniques used for statistical analysis and data visualization such as myplotlib and pandas. My coursework and projects have honed my analytical abilities, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail, which are crucial for a career in digital forensics.

My minor in Law, Criminal Justice, and Society has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the legal system and the societal impacts of crime. I have taken classes and labs focused on forensics and criminalistics, giving me practical experience in examining evidence and understanding criminal procedures. This interdisciplinary knowledge allows me to bridge the gap between technical expertise and legal requirements, ensuring that digital evidence is handled correctly and effectively.

I am particularly interested in uncovering and analyzing digital evidence to help solve cybercrimes and support legal investigations. My goal is to work with law enforcement agencies, private firms, or cybersecurity teams to protect digital assets and provide critical evidence for criminal cases.

## Leadership

### Rowing
For the past 9 years, I have competed in rowing, participating at the high school, collegiate, and club levels. Throughout these years, I have learned invaluable lessons in consistency, grit, and time management, which were essential for earning medals. As a coxswain, I developed strong leadership skills, guiding and motivating my team both during races and everyday at practice. I also was chosen to be my college team's Equipment Manager due to my organizational skills and technical understanding of repairs, purchasing, and care for the equipment in our fleet. 

### Coaching
Along with competing, I also have had the opportunity to take up coaching for the past 3 years at both the high school and collegiate levels. At the high school level, I have been able build athletes to qualify and compete at the national championship regatta for the past two consecutive years and guide students to recruitment at colleges of their choice. At the collegiate level, I have been able to push my athletes to compete on the national level against their fellow students just months after being introduced to the sport. I strive to inspire commitment and a drive for success in any team I am a part of, and as I shift into professional work, I am excited for those opportunities that lie ahead.
